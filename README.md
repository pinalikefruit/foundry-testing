# Intro to testing and security of smart contracts with Foundry

## Introduction

This is a repository where you can learn the fundamental steps to use Foundry, a smart contract testing framework.

A contract to mine NFTs is used as an example, and we will see step by step how Foundry allows us to test it to find flaws and security vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Download Foundry with the command:
`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`
- Run the `foundryup` command 
- Verify the installation of the three most important Foundry tools (`forge`, `cast` and `chisel`) by running the commands:
```
forge --version
> forge 0.2.0 

chisel --version
> chisel 0.1.1 

cast --version
> cast 0.2.0
```

## Setup

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/pinalikefruit/foundry-testing
cd foundry-testing
```
```
forge test
```

## Commands

Install 
```
# Instalation
curl -L [https://foundry.paradigm.xyz](https://foundry.paradigm.xyz/) | bash
foundryup

#Initialization
forge init

#If you want to create a new project using a different template, you would pass the --template flag, like so:
forge init --template https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-template hello_template
```
 Basic commands
 ```

forge build  # Compile
forge test   # test
forge test â€”mt `funtion_name`
forge test --match-path `direction_file`
 ```

 * Add solidity version 
 `foundry.toml` 
 ```
 solc_version = "0.8.18"
 ```

 -   [x] Remapping

```shell
forge remappings
forge install rari-capital/solmate
forge update lib/solmate
forge remove solmate ## Remove library

npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
```

or 
``` 
forge remappings #Then the install dependencies
forge remappings > remappings.txt
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```
-   [x] Formatter

```shell
forge fmt
```

---

---

-   [x] console (Counter, test, log int)

```shell
forge test --match-path test/Console.t.sol -vv
```

forge create [file.sol] --interactive
forge create [file.sol] --private-key 0x....
forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --private-key 0x
cast --to-basae 0x714c2 dec
